# Wrench

Wrench is an extensible runtime host for the Wren programming language. It enables you to write modular applications with modules that can have their performance critical parts implemented in C and their high level logic in Wren.

## Building

## Tests
After building the Wrench host binary and some modules you can run `./Wrench.exe tests/*.spec.wren`
